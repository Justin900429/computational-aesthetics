# README

## Introduction
This repo is to extract the computational aesthetic features introduced from the paper - ["The Pictures we Like are our Image: Continuous Mapping of Favorite Pictures into Self-Assessed and Attributed Personality Traits"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7378902). Some of the features had been removed and readapted. See the table below.

> The description column is omitted. To see what each feature does, please refer to the Paper. Additionally, there are some changes being made.
> 1. The **Faces features** was removed.
> 2. The realization of **color diversity** is different from the paper. 
> 3. The **GIST descriptors** was removed.
> 4. The **GLCM - features** used only gray image and left only 4 features.

## How to use ?

### Install requirements
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/Justin900429/computational-aesthetics
```

### Import file
```python
from CA import CA
...
# Create objects
img_path = "..."
ca = CA(img_path)
res = ca.compute_ca()
...
# update image path
new_path = "..."
ca.update(new_path)
new_res = ca.compute_ca()
...
```
